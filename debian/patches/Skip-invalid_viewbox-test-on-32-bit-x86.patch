Subject: Skip invalid_viewbox test on 32-bit x86

This test appears to be failing on i386, possibly due to extended
precision in the i387 FPU. Building with -mfpmath=sse might resolve this,
but that isn't currently allowed in Debian due to our i386 baseline
being 20 years old (in particular no SSE and no SSE2).
