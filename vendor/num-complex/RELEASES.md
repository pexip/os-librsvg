# Release 0.2.0

### Enhancements

- [`Complex` now implements `num_traits::Inv` and `One::is_one`][17].
- [`Complex` now implements `Sum` and `Product`][11].
- [`Complex` now supports `i128` and `u128` components][27] with Rust 1.26+.
- [`Complex` now optionally supports `rand` 0.5][28], implementing the
  `Standard` distribution and [a generic `ComplexDistribution`][30].
- [`Rem` with a scalar divisor now avoids `norm_sqr` overflow][25].

### Breaking Changes

- [`num-complex` now requires rustc 1.15 or greater][16].
- [There is now a `std` feature][22], enabled by default, along with the
  implication that building *without* this feature makes this a `#![no_std]`
  crate.  A few methods now require `FloatCore`, and the remaining methods
  based on `Float` are only supported with `std`.
- [The `serde` dependency has been updated to 1.0][7], and `rustc-serialize`
  is no longer supported by `num-complex`.
