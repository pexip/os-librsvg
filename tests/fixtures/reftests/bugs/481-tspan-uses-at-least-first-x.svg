    As of July 2019, librsvg does not support multiple positions in
    the x/y/dx/dy attributes of text/tspan elements.  This test is to
    check that the library at least uses the first position specified.

    (The reference PNG for this SVG is incorrect with respect to the
    spec, since we don't actually use the second and third positions;
    it's as if the "Foo" had normal letter spacing.)
